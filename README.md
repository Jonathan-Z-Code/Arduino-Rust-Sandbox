# Arduino Rust Sandbox
Welcome to the Arduino Rust Sandbox! <br/> 
By: Jonathan Zurita 

Here are some coding examples I have created through the arduino no_std library provided
by Rahix! <br/>

All coding files I have created are located in the src/bin folder <br/>
I have also left the `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` file in order for anyone to cross-check dependencies on their machine.

## Documentation Links
This Github Pages integration provides documentation for all source files within `src/bin`. Look at the "Crates" section in the 
bottom left side in order to search through each example file.
